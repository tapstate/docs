Use this page when you are authoring or reviewing a `.tap.yml` file and need an
exact field name, type, required flag, default, or accepted value. Start with
[Resource grammar](/docs/reference/dsl-grammar) to choose a resource kind, then
use the matching table here to complete or check its YAML.

The tables are generated from the `tapstate-v1.schema.json` shipped with the
documented release. They describe what that release's YAML contract accepts;
they do not prove that every declared field or surface is available in the
current preview runtime. For the execution boundary, see [Resource grammar](/docs/reference/dsl-grammar#declaration-and-execution-are-different-checks).

## Field naming constraints and document stores

Field and table names follow standard SQL naming identifiers. When writing to document stores (such as MongoDB):

- **Dots in column names**: A column name containing a dot (such as `price.usd`) is written as a literal dotted field key. In document stores like MongoDB, querying by path interprets the dot as navigation into a nested document, which will not match literal dotted keys unless explicitly escaped. Furthermore, MongoDB indexes cannot be created on keys containing literal dots.
- **Apply-time advisory**: When applying a pipeline that maps dotted column names to a document-store sink, tapstate reports an advisory diagnostic `schema.column-name-reads-as-a-path` (Severity: WARNING). This warning does not refuse the pipeline or block execution, but alerts you to the querying and indexing limitation. If you plan to query or index the field, rename the column at the source or use a `map` transform step to alias the dot to an underscore (for example, `price_usd`) before writing to the target.

## Runtime boundary

Schema acceptance does not prove that a connector artifact is installed or that
the current runtime executes every declared transform, view, or serve surface.
See the [resource grammar](/docs/reference/dsl-grammar) for the current preview
execution boundary.
